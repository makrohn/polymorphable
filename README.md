Laurelia's Polymorphable Citizens
=================================

Originally created for the 2012 Liberated Pixel Cup, this game is based upon Clint Bellanger's FLARE engine.  Our goal is to create a game which draws upon several different classics in the genre, with a heavy emphasis on polymorphable main character.

Laurelia's Polymorphable Citizen (or just Polymorphable for short) is an action-rpg based on the Flare engine. We're aiming a little more towards an 8-bit adventure classic feel, only with more RPG aspects (ie. attribute choices on level up!)

The core mechanic in Polymorphable is using different talismans to polymorph into different forms so you can reach different areas. Imagine being blocked by a pit, so you transform into a bat to fly across. Or perhaps there's a wall of fire in front of you, so you turn into ghost form to phase right through.

Savefile Change!
================

On 2/21/2013, the savefile mechanic was changed.  If you want to use your old savefiles from before the change, copy them from your Polymorphable save directory to your Flare save directory, and rename them from save#.txt to poly_save#.txt
