him=Thank you for finding both halves of the Talisman!
him=Now I will make them whole again.
you=So, what do I do now with this thing?
him=Go south to the Snow Mountain.  The ancient texts say that is where Zalkaz makes his lair.
you=Does he have a sled to come back down on?
him=Of course not!  He's a bat!  Be prepared for anything.

him=Ah, the Fairy Flower!  Did you run into any trouble in the forest?
you=Yes, I did.  I suppose I ought to thank you for the sword.
him=Snarks?  Grumpkins?
you=No, I just, you know, unleashed an ancient evil.  Thanks a bunch for the warning.
him=Ah, I hoped that I would never have to tell you.  You see, I never told you about your parents.  You weren't actually left on my doorstep - the house you live in was theirs, before they left to seal away the ancient evil Zalkaz.
you=When in the heck were you planning on letting me know the truth!?
him=Tomorrow, after your birthday party, I promise!  They died nobly, but now, it falls to you to finish their work.
him=You must find what they never could: both halves of the Juggernaut Talisman.  With the Talisman, you can seal away the Ancient Evil forever!
him=Go east, and use your bat talisman to fly over the ruined bridge, and seek the first half of the Juggernaut Talisman in the volcano.

him=Ah, Daphne!  It's good to see you this morning.  You turn sixteen tomorrow, but it seems like just yesterday that I found you in a basket at my door.
you=Sixteen long years of doing pointless chores for you, Thomas.
him=Come now, you wound an old man!  Tomorrow you shall be released from my endless tasks, but today, I need you to do one more.
you=Joy of joys.  Where are you sending me today?
him=I need you to find the Fairy Flower in the forests.  It's the last ingredient I need to create the wreath to hang in your new home.
you=A housewarming present I have to fetch myself?  Awww, you shouldn't have.
him=Ha!  You're my girl.  The Fairy Flower is found north of town, across the river.  Here's a sword just in case you find trouble.
you=Aww, thanks.  All the years of learning swordplay from Clara shouldn't go to waste, then, if I run into any vicious logs.
him=You never know!

him=I know your parents will rest much better knowing that their work is finished.
you=May they rest in peace...  Thank you, Thomas.
him=Be wary, though.  Zalkaz is but one of the many evils who threaten our world.  I hope that someday you can venture beyond Laurelia, where the world may have use of your sword once more.
you=Oh great, just what I always wanted...  more bats and snakes to kill.
